            <p>When viewing this visualization, one of the first things that is noticeable is the fact that the visual itself is very intuitive to understand and allows you to grasp the information it is trying to convey fairly easily. It pertains to people who are looking to do either covid safe activities or stay away from the dangerous activities in terms of exposure risk. This chart includes the data of activities ranging from least risky to most risky to do when it comes to covid with one of the main factors being color hue as a defining factor. The riskier the activity the redder the color of the circle gets. This is also supported by the implementation of the x axis which clearly shows risk increasing the further right the graph goes. Likewise, size also plays a factor within the graph as the larger the circle the more risk it represents as well. Positioning is also used wisely within the graph as there are two lines that act as separators between risk levels which also brings the idea of ordinal data usage into play. The graph is clearly enlightening as often, we want to enjoy activities like partying or going to a sporting event, however the graph has these clearly shown in dark red when compared to other activities which subconsciously gives the idea of danger. Likewise, by having other fun activities such as going to the beach or golf may dissuade people from more dangerous stuff. The principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty and insightfulness are all present as the data is accurate and is easy to understand and make decisions based on the graph. The data is truthful in showing what activities are risky and does not try to mislead the reader as the same data is echoed by different academic sources. It is also beautiful in that it is simple in design and uses uniform shapes while also transitioning from a yellow to dark red gradient as risk increases. It provides insight into what viewers should and should not be doing but may not be enlightening in that it doesn’t elicit the viewer to do other activities but merely informs them. Overall, the graph does a great job in its purpose of showing covid risk in different activities all the while being easy to understand and not creating too much hassle for the viewer. </p>

            <p>The audience for this graph is lawmakers and vaccine companies in the United Kingdom who are searching for which age groups need an increase in vaccination availability and whether reducing age requirements for Covid vaccines is necessary at all. The chart tells us that in the time between rounds 12 and 13 of pandemic time period, younger people have experienced significant upticks in positive covid tests. The lines on the bars tell us that from round 12-13, the prevalence of covid positivity among 18-24 year olds nearly quadrupled and among 13-17 year olds, there was nearly a 10x increase in positivity. The data encoded is the proportion of the population for each age group, their different positivity rates from round 12 (gray) to round 13 (orange), and how many multiples of the round 12 rate make up the round 13 rate. The data is encoded also in a two-way bar chart displaying weighted positivity prevalence among age groups from round 12 (late may-mid june) to round 13 (late june-early july). Readers can compare changes within each age group by identifying the differences between age groups, and understand how much those pertain to the whole population by proportion. This visualization is good because it shows the population weight of each group.  It is aesthetically pleasing (the green proportion label at the bottom really pops out).  The two axis labels are easy to comprehend and the title gives you a very important point to analyze at the top. The bars are cut up to visually prove, by showing multiples, that each age group really did have an increase of exactly 3 or more multiples.

            <p>The audience is anyone who is interested in Shirley Wu, the creator, and her travels. People who may not want to go through all of her pictures and would prefer to see a condensed summary such as this would also be the target audience. This visualization is one of many on her travel blog, where she aggregates the pictures taken on her trips and the main colors in them. The rings also convey details about the trip, such as who she traveled with or visited, as well as some minor details about the day. In terms of data encoded within the visualization, it represents the creator’s travels, from the duration, the location, the colors that she thought were compelling, what she did, where she went, and who she saw. Shirley uses several encodings within the graph ranging from angle, area, color saturation, hue, and containment. Readers can appreciate the attention to color and design, especially how she took out the colors of the pictures to form an abstract representation of her sights. Trends of who she traveled with, what she sees interesting, and how much she enjoys her experience can also be identified with enough examination. In terms of the five principles that are present, the graph is truthful as there is no reason to expect that the creator is not being truthful with her visualization, as it is mostly for her own exercise. She has attached her credentials, and she appears to be an avid learner of data visualization, and this is likely a practice of those skills. It is also functional since the pie chart is interactive, allowing the reader to hover over certain slices and gain additional information that may not be readily apparent otherwise.The use of a pie chart is creative; using a circle to depict her trip as a whole and then each slice as a day is very effective. The graph is beautiful with abstract splotches of colors that draw the viewer into the visualization. The color scheme is simple but clean, and the design uses lines and circles in dynamic ways to encode heavy amounts of information while still being pleasing to look at. The graph does provide insight as viewers are free to gather as much information as they would want from the visualization. At the most basic level, they can see what colors she likes taking pictures of or who she traveled with. The graph does lack the enlightening aspect to it but that is expected due to the nature of the data being presented. It does not provide a world changing view, it just gives information about one’s experiences. This visualization is good because of the creative depiction of her message, or in this case her trips. It has both high-level and detailed information, and does this in a beautiful way. Its stylistic elements appear to be just that, until the viewer looks deeper and learns more about the story behind the trip.

            <p>This graph is meant to show the differences among crypto currency investors in terms of education and income demographics when compared to the total population in the US. The graph wants to convey how there is a disparity among who is investing in crypto compared to the general trends in the population to show that certain groups tend to invest more than others. Similarly it is intended to show how the patterns among crypto investors deviate from that of the rest of the adult population. When looking at the graphs, the purpose is clear as the two populations under scrutiny(crypto investors and the rest of the adults) are separated into different bars. However, the graphs have several flaws, one of which being the axis lines. When trying to understand the information in the graph, the labels are not lined up with the portion of the bar that they represent which leads to confusion and extra strain on the audience’s part. Likewise, the colors at times can be too similar as 4 out of 5 of them derive from blue and so the labels can be misinterpreted again. Finally, the nature of stacked bar graphs is that unless it is the value at the very bottom, it is often difficult to compare the different values in the chart and as seen in the chart above, the corresponding sections of the graphs are in different locations making the comparison difficult. The charts themselves do not fulfill most of the 5 principles of design as they are not functional, insightful or enlightening.

            <p>The audience is for people studying employment inequality in various industries and what might cause those inequalities. It’s hard to tell the exact goal, but it seems like the spread of all the lines from one side to the other is meant to show some element of randomness and where father’s sons end up working later in life. The data encoded is the occupation of various fathers and the occupation of their sons. The visualization encodes the data by displaying bars of certain occupations on the father side and a line (representing a father-son pair) to the occupation of the son to show. The reader can pretty much only trace one line (if they have incredible eyes) to the other side. The fact that there is a lot of spread from everywhere seems to suggest that sons don’t always keep the same job as their fathers. The visualization is beautiful in a way that it uses a lot of color, but it is confusing and too cluttered. I wouldn’t call it enlightening or insightful because I'm not sure what is going on.  I’m sure it is truthful, but the confusion distorts the truth a little bit, and with that it doesn’t have too much functionality either
                This visualization is bad because there is no context or control. There are so many things that could affect job choice and they are not included here. Also, the mix of too many colors confuses where some lines lead to and make everything seem almost entirely random.  There is nothing to show how the numbers add up. So, you can’t take away much info from this visualization at all. It might be best to remove some of the possible categories because many things overlap, but here there are so many sub-categories that it is too cluttered.

            <p>The audience for this visualization are people who are interested in Boston College or Missouri football, as well as fans of college football as a whole. People may also want to see this visualization if they want to approach football with a more statistical standpoint, allowing a computer to assist in the analyzing of the game. The visualization depicts the chances of Boston College football winning the game over Missouri, which will ultimately go to 100% as the game concluded with its winner. However, without context, the viewer will wonder what caused the two spikes close to the end of the game, which have the odds of BC winning go from about 60%, to 99%, back to 40%, and then 100% in what appears to be a short period of time. The y-axis also poses some questions about if it makes sense, as well as the idiosyncratic nature of the small ups and downs of the win chance. Ultimately, the visualization has the viewer wondering about several events, but that it was a close game with wild swings. Aspects about the game, such as the score, what down/yardage each possession is, certain significant plays, and the general trend of the game are encoded in the visualization. The win percentage line going up and down encodes the data in a concise manner; by eliminating specific data about every single possession, the algorithm presumably incorporates all of the information and adjusts the line up and down based on a formula. The readers will quickly have their eyes gravitate towards the extreme swings at the end of the game, where the game goes from being all but certain to a toss-up and back to being certain in a short period of time. The audience may also notice the trend of Boston College gaining an advantage for what appears to be the third quarter, and Missouri reclaiming that in what’s likely the fourth quarter. While the graph does not appear to be hiding or misleading data, due to the nature of how the odds of winning are calculated, it is hard to confirm if it is fully truthful. The graph however, is very functional as the visualization is very readable, with an effective encoding of a line chart for depicting the relative strength and advantage of each team throughout the game. It does, however, lack in answering the viewer’s inevitable question of what happened during the game. The graph is beautiful in that it is simple and gets straight to the point of the information. It can also help provide insight into what is happening throughout the game and how it affects a team’s chance of winning. There isn’t really anything enlightening about the graph as it shows the numerical odds of the game and doesn’t serve to provide the reader anything beyond that. This visualization does a good job giving a general overview of how the game was going, allowing the viewer to see its progression and ascertain trends and significant events. However, the bad outweighs the good, as the visualization gets too vague at times. The lack of an x-axis strongly interferes with the viewer’s ability to pinpoint when an event is happening, few tick marks on the confusing y-axis make it difficult to see what each percentage is at any given point, and the lack of citing makes the data less trustworthy and liable to subjectivity.
